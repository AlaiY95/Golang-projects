To DO;

1. Create new user (Alai) in postgres database
2. Change .env with updates variables
3. Add some logic tests for sanity checking 

Improvements
Use SQLBoiler instead of GORM as GORM gives abstraction which is not ideal when trying to pinpoint errors.

CreateBook function
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"author":"Ron Weasly","title":"Harry Potter","publisher":"J K Rowlings"}' http://localhost:8080/api/create_books

Delete Book function
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/delete_book/1 

GetBook function
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/get_books/1 

GetBooks function
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/books

Can also view the books created in Postgres using:
SELECT * FROM public.books;


To fix:
CreateBook function works when using curl but gives "Method Not Allowed" error when usign Postman o_O. Strange:
Fixed! There was a trailing space i the url in Postman! I found this when looking at the the curl request sent by postman! 
Postman was sending the curl below and when pasted into terminal gave curl: (3) URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL!!!
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/create_books/ ' \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --data-raw '{     "author":"Skepta",     "title":"BoyBetterKnow",     "publisher":"Psychosis" }'
